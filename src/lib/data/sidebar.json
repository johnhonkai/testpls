        "rawContent": "\r\n## Astral Ring System\r\nAll valkyries from version 7.3 onwards are called Part 2 valkyries. They use a new Astral Ring (AR) system. This completely changes the valk mechanics and teambuilding.\r\n\r\n## Astral Ring Specializations\r\nA Part 2 valkyrie will have ONE Astral Ring Specialization. There are 12 different AR Specializations in total.\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YTBvruW.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[800px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nEach Specialization has its own unique gameplay mechanic. Here's a summary of each one:\r\n- **World Star (WS):** Can create Resonance Marks. Certain attacks will trigger these Resonance Marks to deal damage.\r\n- **Wheel of Destiny (WOD): ** Centered around solo playstyle. Teammates become shadow atk during Stellar Outburst.\r\n- **Law of Ascension (LoA):** QTE switch playstyle.\r\n- **Rite of Oblivion (RoO):** Every RoO DPS has her own unique playstyle.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Astral Ring Activation\r\n\r\nWhen a Part 2 valkyrie is set as leader, it will activate her AR Specialization.\r\n\r\n## Astral Ring Attribute\r\nEach Astral Ring Specialization has a connected **Astral Ring Attribute** (also called AR tag). You can see this in valk filter menu, or by clicking the AR icons in valk menu.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Tmyke4u.jpeg\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[800px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nA Part 2 character can only have <span class=\"text-emerald-300\">one AR Specialization</span>, but she can have <span class=\"text-amber-400\">multiple AR tags </span>.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/T3c8bhc.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[800px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### What AR Tags are used for\r\n\r\nAR tags determine two things:\r\n1. A valk can support the DPS with the matching AR Specialization and activate the AR's unique mechanics. \r\n2. AR tag is used to activate buffs or allow certain buffs to reach max effects. These include buffs from character skills, weapon, stigma, Astral Ops, and Abyss weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ok6S7OZ.jpeg\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[800px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Rite of Oblivion\r\nThe only exception to these rules is Rite of Oblivion (RoO). \r\n1. RoO characters have buffs that do not require specific AR activation, so in theory, they can support any AR... right?\r\n2. However, **without the matching AR tag, they can't activate certain important mechanics or unique buffs for that AR.** This means, RoO valks are just below average support options for teams without the matching AR tag.\r\n3. Other AR specializations' leader skills require three members with specific AR tags to activate buffs. Rite of Oblivion characters count as a valid member **even without the required AR tag.**\r\n\r\nHere is an example with Coralie. Coralie is a RoO character with Domain Resonance tag.\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0OGO42H.jpeg\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[800px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Terminology\r\nSome terms used by the AR system.\r\n\r\n### Stellar Outburst\r\nAll Part 2 valkyries can enter an enhanced state called Stellar Outburst (SO). You can activate SO when you have enough AR Intensity meter.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/AW3Zx5U.jpeg\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[800px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n### Other Common Terms\r\nYou will see these terms a lot in Part 2 buffs (character, equipment, AstralOp, Abyss weather)\r\n- **Astral Ring Charging**: When AR is activated, but you are not in Stellar Outburst mode.\r\n- **Stellar Outburst**: When AR is activated, and you are in Stellar Outburst mode.\r\n- **Augmented Ascension**: A special state only for Law of Ascension characters. During this state, you are considered to be in Stellar Outburst mode.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Stellar Drain\r\nAll Part 2 characters have Stellar Drain. Basically, you do Combo ATK / certain skill, you gain a good amount of AR Intensity (usually 20). \r\n- Can only trigger once per AR Charging state.\r\n- Stellar Drain refreshes after a Stellar Outburst ends."

Valkyries, equipment and ELFs usually provide buffs for <span class=\"text-sky-300\">one specific element</span> + some Total DMG buff.\r\n3. Most valks are <span class=\"text-sky-300\">either a DPS or a Support</span>. Some supports can also be a dps, but not the best dps, just decent. There's an exception to this - In Part 1.5, we got \r\n Lunar Vow and Herrscher of Rebirth, who are actually good at both DPS and support.\r\n4. A valkyrie usually <span class=\"text-sky-300\">only has ONE best team lineup</span>, consisting of DPS + S-rank Support + SP Support.\r\n\r\n5. For equipment, most of the time equipment are gacha-only. There are farmable options (G3 or G4 Stigma from Foundry), but these take a few months to forge.\r\n\r\n## Part 2 Teambuilding\r\n\r\n1. In Part 2, teams are built based on <span class=\"text-emerald-400\">ASTRAL RING Specializations</span>.\r\n2. Valkyries, equipment and Astral Ops provide buffs for ALL elements, but most of the <span class=\"text-emerald-400\">buffs are restricted to specific AR types.</span>\r\n3. <span class=\"text-emerald-400\">All S-ranks can be a DPS and a support</span>, based on the position in the lineup. Example:\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cnbM5gV.jpeg\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[800px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n4. There are <span class=\"text-emerald-400\">MULTIPLE OPTIMAL TEAM LINEUPS</span>. You are not just restricted to only two specific supports now. Every support has her own unique abilities. For example:\r\n- For Wheel of Destiny teams, <span class=\"text-orange-400\">Senadina</span> can provide powerful buffs like Elemental Breach while staying off-field the entire battle.\r\n- For Wheel of Destiny teams, <span class=\"text-sky-300\">Thelema</span> provides shieldbreak, huge freeze trauma and evasion spam ar regen.\r\n- For World Star teams, <span class=\"text-fuchsia-300\">Herrscher of Finality</span> provides super quick resonance trigger.\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\nBut of course, Honkai Impact is complex. Not all Astral Ring teams have multiple lineups. There are some teams that still only have one best lineup.\r\n- **Herrscher of Finality DPS**: Needs Herrscher of Truth and Herrscher of Origin.\r\n- **Vita Lone Planetfarer DPS**: Needs team members with Astral Ring: Rite of Oblivion (RoO) to activate buffs like Elemental Breach, buffs and stronger Ult. Right now, there are only two RoO valks besides Vita - Herrscher of Finality and Coralie.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n5. For equipment, you only need to gacha for weapon, 60 pulls guarantee max. Stigma is forgeable. You also get a lot of stigma if you pull weapon from gacha. \r\nIn addition, when a new valkyrie debuts, you will get one stigma selector box.\r\n"

Save until you can guarantee valk + full gear.\r\n2. Then, get the latest valk early in the patch.\r\n\r\nThis page will elaborate on the statement above.\r\n\r\n## Longer Patches\r\n\r\nPatches are longer now, that means more crystal for every S-rank release!\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/siQPLIv.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[300px] sm:w-[400px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nF2P can get S-rank valk fullgear <span class=\"text-emerald-300\">every one or two patches</span> (one if you're lucky)\r\n\r\nMonthly / Monthly + BP players, you can get <span class=\"text-emerald-300\">new S-rank every patch now</span> (assuming average luck). You will only have issue deciding what to pull when a patch has extra stuff like Divine Key or AstralOp.\r\n\r\n## All Part 2 Valks are balanced and have their own niche\r\n\r\nYou might have heard I mention these in some character guides:\r\n- \"Badum is a typical Part 2 valk\"\r\n- \"PS is a typical Part 2 valk\"\r\n\r\nWhat a typical Part 2 valk means:\r\n1. The valk top scores her bosses, decent dps everywhere else.\r\n2. Can support multiple valks, but she is only the best support for certain valks.\r\n3. Provides unique utilities that makes her the best DPS or support for certain bosses.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Multiple optimal supports\r\n\r\nThis infographic below shows what you how nice it is that there are so <span class=\"text-emerald-300\">many support options </span> now, and every valk has her own niche.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it's also kinda <span class=\"text-red-300\">disgusting </span> how if you don't have the valk to counter a specific mechanic, some bosses just become unbearable.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Lmo2iVM.jpeg\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[700px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/dDMYn46.jpeg\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[700px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### The Best Supports Keep Changing\r\n\r\nA valk's best team changes based on the boss.\r\nLet's take [Ba-dum!](/valk/badum) as example. Most of the time Badum's best teammates are Vita, Sparkle and JD.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lf46hCn.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[700px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThen, comes a boss with huge shield hp. Now Badum's optimal teammate is Reign Solaris since she provides shieldbreak.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/hEQqUKL.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[700px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThen, boom! Mihoyo adds random blob with bleed trauma just to force the new valk Peregrine Sword to be Badum's teammate.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/E966v6J.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[700px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThat's the first case. Next case:  <span class=\"text-emerald-300\">Teambuilding powercreep</span>.\r\n\r\nLet's say you're a F2P, and you pulled Reign Solaris in v8.0, but you figured out Sparkle is one of the best teammates for her.\r\n\"OK I'll pull Sparkle next patch then\"\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GCue8D3.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[700px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThen v8.1 comes: \"Oh Badum is good for RS too, and Badum herself is great for new bosses. Ok, skip Sparkle then.\"\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/w2IrA7i.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[700px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThen v8.2 comes: \"What, RS best teammate is Peregrine Sword now? And new Helia also uses PS. All valks are good.... \r\nbut I have no crystal to get every valk because Im F2P\"\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0V49aYT.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[700px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Some valks are 'better than typical'\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"/images/valkportrait/Vita Lone Planetfarer.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[100px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<span class=\"text-emerald-300\">\"Vita is more special than other valks.\"</span>\r\n\r\nI know there are some valks that are 'better than typical' like Vita. \r\nThat is true, Vita is the most flexible support in the last few patches (but she's still not the best everywhere, especially at S0-rank).\r\n\r\nIf you got her on debut, then congrats. But if you were thinking to get Vita on rerun, then the problem remains the same- **<span class=\"text-blue-300\"> CRYSTALS </span>**. You don't have crystals.\r\n\r\nIf you're a monthly player/whaler, who can afford new valk + Vita, then yeah, it was worth it to get Vita on her rerun. \r\n\r\nBut for a F2P player who can only afford one S-rank valk every one or two patches, was it worth it skipping new valk to pull Vita rerun?\r\n**ABSOLUTELY NOT.**\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Uncertainty of a valk's future value\r\n\r\nCharacters also have locked skills for future AR, which can hide their true value until their locked skill is revealed.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"/images/valkportrait/sparkle.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[100px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nTake [Sparkle](/valk/sparkle) for example. During her release, Sparkle looked really underwhelming in World Star teams. She was good in P1 Fire but that didn't matter much when AR is the new craze.\r\n\r\nThen, Law of Ascension was revealed. Turns out Sparkle has one of the best kits for that AR.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/DCcxjlv.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[900px] -mt-2 h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n> And of course, valks with new Astral Ring should be a higher priority to pull, right?\r\n\r\n> So F2P should just skip the valk in the current patch to guarantee this new valk with new AR next patch, right?\r\n\r\nWell turns out the best support for that valk with new AR is the valk from previous patch\r\n (Sparkle for RS, PS for Helia). Now your shiny new AR is not at its full potential.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/QXtAsij.jpeg\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[700px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Get the new valk early in the patch\r\n\r\nThe reason  you want to get a valk early in the patch is to get the most value out of her DPS role.\r\n\r\nFor most valkyries, their bosses appear during the first 3-4 weeks of the new patch. After that, their bosses will only appear once in a while, and the valk will be used more often as support (outside of Arena mode).\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/q4gfUja.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[700px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Bt4C0s8.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[700px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VExJexC.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[700px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n##  Save until you can guarantee valk + full gear \r\n\r\nYou really really want to get valk + weapon.\r\n\r\nWeapon has always been very important in HI3. There's usually important utilities locked behind weapon and there is no good alternative F2P options.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you dont have Reign Solaris' weapon, her attacks won't have the img dmg transfer mechanic, on top of the usual dmg loss.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://ldbndupsaerjtcndwoqq.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/guidepics/dmg%20test%20rs%20dps%20img.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[700px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nWith signature weapon, Planar Armament gain 10% more initial sp during SO. This seems like an important utility considering she consumes a lot of sp during SO.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MLzRV4N.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[900px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nFor support role, all P2 weapons now have this <span class=\"text-cyan-300\">independent multiplier</span>.\r\nUnless you have another compatible P2 weapon, the dmg loss from not having this independent multiplier is big enough that you would be better off using another support with full gear (unless the boss requires a specific utility that the valk can provide).\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/RL1lBuA.jpeg\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[900px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n##  New Valk is Cheaper\r\nNew valkyries usually come with 50% off for the first ten pulls of Battlesuit Supply.\r\n\r\n##  END\r\nThat's it for this page. Hopefully, this page has laid out all the factors that lead us to the conclusion for this pull recommendation:\r\n\r\nDue to how meta works (all valks are kinda balanced on release and have their own niche) \r\n\r\nand how patches are longer (Monthly players can get new S-rank fullgear every patch, and f2p can get new S-rank fullgear every one or two patches), \r\n\r\nitâ€™s better to:\r\n\r\n1. Save until you can guarantee valk + full gear.\r\n2. Then, get the latest valk early in the patch."

You earn a currency called <span class=\"text-pink-300\">Immutable Crystallum</span> which can be used to purchase past S-rank characters and equipment released 3+ years ago.\r\n2. If you purchase the paid tier, you'll receive additional Crystallum and gain access to more recent S-rank characters and equipment from the past 1â€“2 years.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gTlcztl.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[300px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## BP Tiers\r\nThere are three tiers - <span class=\"text-teal-300\">Vanguard</span> (Free), <span class=\"text-orange-300\">Knight</span> (~10 USD), and <span class=\"text-red-300\">Paladin</span> (~20 USD). \r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/WAXr9VU.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[600px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n### Crystallum Income Per Patch\r\n- Vanguard: 5\r\n- Knight: 18\r\n- Paladin: 24\r\n\r\n\r\n### Some notable rewards for the paid tier\r\n- Knight / Paladin BP unlocks the ability to purchase S-rank character and equipment from 1-2 years ago.\r\n- Knight / Paladin BP gives fragments for the featured S-rank. Knight 10 frags, Paladin 10+20 = 30 frags.\r\n- Paladin BP gives Wafer Stabilizer and Dataflow, used to fine-tune stigma affix stats. This is useful for competitive players.\r\n- Cosmetic: Knight BP gives an outfit / outfit box, Paladin BP gives a ribbon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## BP Works Shop\r\n\r\nBP Works Shop has S-rank characters from the last 1-2 years, and the content of the shop can only be purchased if you buy Knight or Paladin Pass.\r\n\r\n![BP Equipment](https://i.imgur.com/Z84WA7B.png)\r\n\r\n### How the shop works\r\n- In each version, BP Works adds a set of S-rank character and her equipment.\r\n- Every set lasts for 3 versions.\r\n- The shop has 3 sets: set from current patch and previous two patches. Since the shop is new, v8.2 will only have the v8.2 S-rank set.\r\n- Purchasing Knight or Paladin BP will allow you to purchase all 3 sets that are available in that version. In the next version, if you don't buy Knight or Paladin BP, you cannot purchase the content of the new set added in that version, but you can still purchase the set from the previous 2 versions.\r\n\r\nIf you don't get how it works, here's a visual example:\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Pc8vtf5.jpeg\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[600px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Should You Get Senadina / Whatever Character in There?\r\nIf you can afford it, yeah definitely. Since Part 2 characters all have their niche as both dps and support, then it is worth getting Senadina + weapon, or whatever character is going to be in the shop.\r\n\r\n>I can only afford one S-rank + weapon out of the three, which one should I get?\r\n\r\nRefer to [each valk guide page](/valk) for more info. But general answer for most cases: Get Part 2 valk first. If all the sets are for Part 2 valk, then get the latest valk.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Reserve Works Shop\r\n\r\nReserve Works Shop has all S-rank characters and most equipment from over 3 years ago. Currently, the content of the shop is up until <span class=\"text-pink-300\"> Herrscher of Human patch (v6.0) </span>.\r\n\r\nThe developers have stated that this shop will be updated gradually over time.\r\n\r\n![BP Equipment](https://i.imgur.com/QfzNLWO.png)\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Best Item to Get\r\n\r\n#### 1. BP Works Item\r\nReminder: Items in Reserve Works uses **the same currency** as BP Works Shop. It is always better to purchase item in BP Works since they are newer.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### 2. Divine Keys\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ayypL15.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[700px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nDivine Keys give global +10 ATK for all characters. When these stack up, they can give a significant damage increase, equal to having a second weapon on your valk.\r\n\r\nHowever, do note that some Divine Keys have been given for free in the past, and may be available in major spending event (happens twice a year).

If you have not maxed her ranks yet, then you can consider getting her stamps from this shop.\r\n\r\n**Regarding buying HoH battlesuit for F2P** <br/>\r\nFor F2P, 24 Crystallum cost is VERY EXPENSIVE. It is equal to 5 patches worth of Crystallum, that is almost a year worth! \r\n\r\n**For new players that can afford it** <br/>\r\nHoH battlesuit is available in starter B-chip pack. Save your Crystallum and get HoH from the pack instead.\r\n\r\n**Note**<br/> \r\nOnly get the stamps, don't get her equipment. She uses a different set for Part 2. [Please go to Herrscher of Human guide page to learn more.](/valk/hoh)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### 4. Save\r\n\r\nEverything else in the Reserve Works shop is outdated.

Her buffs are centered around weapon skill, so she's more effective for Senadina than Schicksal's Imperative and Sparkle.\r\n- Their synergy weapon upgrade materials are very expensive. You should finish ranking up Coralie and Helia first (and whatever other character that you want), then you can purchase the material later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Part 1 Valkyries\r\n\r\nMost Part 1 characters are already obselete. Some of them are still useful for new players, but there's no urgency to farm them, as their impact on your account late game is not that big.\r\n\r\n### Elysian Realm\r\nThese characters are available in Elysian Realm mode. \r\n- You can get <span class=\"text-blue-300\">620 crystals</span> from first-clear mission, PER VALK. \r\n- You only need to unlock them at A-rank for Elysian Realm. \r\n- Unlocking and ranking them up also improves your Dorm Level EXP, which grants you global ATK and buffs - and it helps you fulfill S+ rank Dorm Errand requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### A-rank Valkyries\r\n\r\n![Characters in Elysian Realm](https://i.imgur.com/RdlOVa8.jpeg)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Augment Core Selector \r\n\r\nFor Augment Core selector, these are the augment valks that are available in Elysian Realm.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/pL8naO3.jpeg\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[650px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n- You need the base valkyries + augment cores to unlock them in Elysian Realm, so it will take longer to get compared to the A-rank valks above.\r\n- Not recommended to purchase these all at once since it can get costly. You can get the core slowly over time from Open World, then purchase the remaining cores required to unlock the next augment upgrade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Asterite Currency\r\n\r\nYou can get Asterite currency naturally by doing dailies, weeklies, events, Dorm Shop, Battle Pass, supplies and more (Just click the currency icon, then press GET, it will show you all the source for Asterite).\r\n\r\nThere is one feature to get Asterite that might be easily missed / forgotten by new players.\r\n\r\nAs you complete missions, you gain Energy. And you can use energy to convert excess materials into Asterites. Check this once a week. However, as a new player, you might not have enough materials to do this exchange. It is fine to let it stay maxed out.\r\n\r\n![ast 1](https://i.imgur.com/H04wmVA.jpeg)\r\n\r\n![ast 2](https://i.imgur.com/kW8RNO1.jpeg)\r\n\r\n![ast 3](https://i.imgur.com/BHGSQRN.jpeg)\r\n\r\n![ast 4](https://i.imgur.com/OUPA0A1.jpeg)\r\n"

Back then, it was the best shop in the game, because you can get characters like Knight Moonbeam and Lightning Empress, which actually improved your account. You could even get a gacha weapon back then.\r\n\r\nNow, War Treasury shop is just a retirement home for Part 1 valks.\r\n\r\n## Ancient Willpower and Ancient Legacy\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/u5EOove.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[300px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n**Ancient Willpower (AW)** and **Ancient Legacy (AL)** are the currencies used in War Treasury shop.

Just keep in mind they will not be a big improvement for your account even when fully geared since the meta right now is all about Part 2.

So here are some quick important tips to prevent you from wasting important resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Do Not Pull Starter Supply\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/X1c2whI.jpeg\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[800px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nStarter Supply is bad for a number of reasons:\r\n1. Due to how the meta works, it is better to use your crystal to pull the newest valkyrie. As F2P, your crystal income is very limited, you can only get **ONE** S-rank fully-geared every one or two patches, so you don't want to waste your crystal on older valks.\r\n2. Starter supply is only available for 90 days, and the guarantee counter is not shared with other supplies. Normal supplies are always available (in rotation) and the guarantee counter is shared with other normal supplies.\r\n3. The character [Deepspace Anchor](/valk/sena) is available in Battle Pass version 8.2 - 8.4. If you can afford it, consider purchasing Battle Pass to get her instead of pulling her from this supply. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Do Not Upgrade Everything\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lgqzwbX.jpeg\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[800px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nHonkai Impact is 8 years old, that means 8 YEARS WORTH OF OUTDATED CONTENT. You will get a lot of characters and equipment from starter event, Dorm Supplies, shops, etc. Don't spend your resources on every single character or gear that you get. That is an easy way to go bankrupt on materials in early game. Use it only on the latest valkyries. \r\n\r\n## Do Dailies and Events\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/j2MK187.jpeg\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[800px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThis is where your dailies / weeklies / limited-time event missions are.\r\n\r\n\r\n## The Best Starter Team\r\n\r\nNone. All those free characters are old Part 1 valks or missing weapon and stigma.\r\n\r\nThe best starter team is the first Part 2 S-rank that you pulled. Then, put [Coralie Valkyrie Blastmetal](/valk/coralie) as the support. It will be A LOT better than whatever you get from those starter events.\r\n\r\n\r\n## There is No Broken Character\r\n\r\nThere is no Castorice or Mavuika or Miyabi in Honkai Impact. \r\n\r\n1. The most important end-game mode EX Abyss uses a 'Weather' system, which buffs certain damage types or characters (like Fire UP, Melee UP, Imaginary Type UP), and every patch adds new bosses with weird mechanics that favor the newest characters. These factors combined have ensured that no character can be the best at everything. Some DPS can bruteforce more bosses than others, but can never bruteforce everything.\r\n\r\n2. You may have heard a famous online saying of <span class=\"text-emerald-500\"> \"Pull support first because they last longer.\"</span> Well, that quote is from Part 1. All Part 2 S-ranks are both DPS and Support.\r\n\r\n### So, what do I pull with my crystal?\r\n\r\nPull the latest S-rank. \r\n\r\n\r\n## The Real Game Starts at Level 80+\r\n\r\nOnce you get to Level 80, you can breakthrough, increasing your max level, and unlocking an entirely new difficulty tier called **Exalted Tier** and a new end-game mode **Superstring Dimension**. \r\n\r\nYes, it is harder, but manageable, and gives significantly more crystal income per week. \r\n\r\nIt only takes around a month for a new account to get to Lv80."

For mobile, only the default app for your region is displayed on Google Play and iOS App Store.\r\n- Europe (EU) & Americas (NA) (They share one client)\r\n- Japan (JP)\r\n- Korea (KR)\r\n- South-East Asia (SEA)\r\n- Traditional Chinese Server (equivalent to TW, HK, MO servers in Genshin/StarRail). \r\n\r\nOnly SEA, EU and NA servers use <span class=\"text-emerald-400\">English language</span>.\r\n\r\n\r\n![List of available HI3 servers in Hoyoplay](https://i.imgur.com/PEyX4D0.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Server Differences for SEA, NA, EU\r\n\r\n### App Name\r\nFor mobile, SEA app name is <span class=\"text-emerald-400\">Honkai Impact 3</span>. EU / NA app name is <span class=\"text-emerald-400\">Honkai Impact 3rd</span>.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Voice, UI Language and Reset Time\r\n| Server | Voice Over | UI Language | Server Time |\r\n|  --------  |  :-----:  |  --------  |  -------  |\r\n| SEA | JP, CN | English , CN, Viet, Indo, Thai | UTC +8 |\r\n| Europe  | JP, CN  | English, CN, French, German | UTC +1 |\r\n| Americas | JP, CN  | English, CN, French, German| UTC -5 |\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Touch Feature\r\nIn SEA server, you can touch valkyries! This feature is only available for very old Part 1 valkyries.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n\r\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" max-width=\"420\" max-height=\"300\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rJ3IQ_MLvac\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen>\r\n </iframe>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Anniversary Date\r\nOriginally, the regional servers had different anniversary date. But starting from Part 2 (v7.3), our anniversaries are synced to around Feb/March (7.3 date is Feb 29, 2024).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Server Population\r\nSEA server has significantly more players. It is unclear who has more players for NA and EU.\r\n\r\n**Online matchmaking:** HI3 has multiplayer events from time to time like Fall Guys, Chibi Lobby and HSR Collab card event. Matchmaking is faster in SEA server. \r\nI once tried EU server, and took a long time to get a match in Fall Guys event.\r\n\r\n**Competitive:** HI3's hardest mode is EX Abyss - it has ranking system and extra crystals and emblems for reaching Top 100 in every round.\r\n- Since there are more players, it's harder to get Top 50 in SEA server.\r\n- Top 100 score breakpoint is also much higher in SEA than NA / EU.\r\n- Nirvana group retention is easier in SEA than NA / EU because more players = more brackets = less chance to be in the same room with T100 players.\r\n- For Red Lotus group, EU server has lower Disturbance than other servers (enemies have less HP).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Physical Merch Limitation\r\nFrom time to time, there are physical merch giveaways like Art Collection and raffle event. Physical merch is only shipped to certain countries tied to the server geographically. Below is an example of Art Collection Vol 2 shipping areas for SEA server.\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/x5GhDxz.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\" h-80 w-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## So, which server should you play?\r\nBy default, it's best to play the default server for your region.\r\n- For an easier chance at reaching Top 100, then consider EU or NA server.\r\n- If you're looking for faster matchmaking and more populated in-game lobbies, then play SEA server.\r\n- If getting physical merch matters to you, choose the default server for your region.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## More Server Trivia\r\n\r\n- The six servers (on Hoyoplay) are officially known as **Regional Servers**, indicating that these servers are different from the mainland China server - **CN Server.** CN server is ahead by around 4 weeks. This is why we EN players can plan ahead with our pulls. \r\n- EU and NA share a client. They are commonly referred to as Global (GLB) server. \r\n- For iOS and Android, the default server is based on your region. You can get apk files of other server clients from 3rd-party app stores.\r\n- Steam client uses EU / NA server, but it uses Steam ID and cannot connect to your Hoyoverse account.\r\n- **Traditional Chinese**: Not to be confused with the actual CN server. Traditional Chinese has the same update time as EN servers. This server is equivalent to TW, HK, MO servers in Genshin/StarRail.\r\n- **CN server:** CN server is ahead by around 4 weeks. This is why we EN players can plan ahead with our pulls. There are multiple CN servers (PC, iOS, Android, Oppo, Taptap, Bilibili and more)\r\n- **JP server** has higher drop rate, but does not have guarantee in supplies. I don't know if this is still the case after Part 2 update.\r\n\r\n"

All Part 2 content are available from these gacha:\r\n- Battlesuit Supply\r\n- Equipment Supply\r\n- AstralOp Supply\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Battlesuit Supply\r\nThis is where you pull S-rank characters.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/MtRcDfT.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[700px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n- Content: One featured S-rank, one featured A-rank, three other A-ranks.\r\n- Cost per pull: 280 crystal, or one Battlesuit Supply Card.\r\n- Every 10 pulls guarantee an A-rank or S-rank valk.\r\n- Featured S-rank is guaranteed within 90 pulls / 25,200 crystals. \r\n- Usually, there is a 50% discount for the first ten pulls for new S-rank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Equipment Supply\r\nThis is where you pull the equipment.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/RA9zQ0z.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[700px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n- Content: One featured weapon + stigma set (Top, Mid, Bottom).\r\n- Cost per pull: 280 crystal, or one Equipment Supply Card.\r\n- Every 10 pulls guarantee weapon or one of the stigma pieces.\r\n- Featured weapon is guaranteed within 60 pulls / 16,800 crystals.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### AstralOp Supply\r\nThis is where you pull AstralOp. What is AstralOp? Well it's basically like Bangboo, but what if the Bangboo is broken like Castorice? Yeah.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0gnfg99.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[700px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n- Content: One featured S-rank AstralOp.\r\n- Cost per pull: 280 crystal, or one Equipment Supply Card.\r\n- Every 10 pulls guarantee AstralOp or some upgrade materials.\r\n- Featured AstralOp is guaranteed within 60 pulls / 16,800 crystals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Special Part 2 Supplies\r\n\r\nWhen a valkyrie is over 8 patches old, that valkyrie might be available in these special supplies:\r\n\r\n### Ascension Supply\r\n\r\n\r\nA special version of Battlesuit Supply, where you can get a valk and instantly rank her up to SS-rank if you do 90 pulls.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/k8PkfXz.jpeg\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[700px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n- Cost per pull: 280 crystal, or one Ascension Supply Card.\r\n- Every 10 pulls guarantee an A-rank or S-rank valk.\r\n- Featured S-rank is guaranteed within 90 pulls / 25,200 crystals. \r\n- Pull until 90 pulls to get 10 stamps (100 fragments), enough to unlock a valk and her rank her up to SS-rank.\r\n- Guarantee counter for each Ascension Supply banner is not carried over to other Ascension Supply banner.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Armament Ascension Supply\r\n\r\nA special version of Equipment Supply, where you can get up to 18 Equipment Supply cards. Basically, like a rebate.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/r8Lzsbm.jpeg\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[700px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n- Cost per pull: 280 crystal, or one Equipment Supply Card.\r\n- Every 10 pulls guarantee weapon or one of the stigma pieces.\r\n- Featured weapon is guaranteed within 60 pulls / 16,800 crystals.\r\n- Every 10 pulls gives 3 Equipment Supply Cards, max 18 Equipment Supply cards can be obtained (at 60 pulls).\r\n- Guarantee counter for each Armament Ascension banner is not carried over to other Armament Ascension banner.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Pull Valk + Weapon\r\n\r\nIn Honkai Impact, weapon is very important. Most of the time, signature weapon has a very important utility that completes the valkyrie. There's no good farmable alternative for weapon like in Star Rail or Genshin Impact.\r\n\r\nImagine if Imbibitor Lunae only has maximum 1 Lotus stack by default, and only gets 3 max Lotus stack if he has signature Light Cone.\r\n\r\nWell, that's basically what happens to Jovial Deception. She only has 3 meter stack by default, and only gets 6 meter stack with signature weapon.\r\n\r\n![6 stack vs 3 stack](https://i.imgur.com/nITEGhN.png)\r\n"

A character or enemy can only have one type.\r\n- Biologic (BIO)\r\n- Mechanical (MECH)\r\n- Psychic (PSY)\r\n- Quantum (QUA)\r\n- Imaginary (IMG)\r\n- Stardust (SD)\r\n- Enemies can also be typeless\r\n\r\n## Type Counter Relationship\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 my-0 py-0\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/aJVugXg.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"w-[700px] h-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nImage above shows the relationship between types.\r\n- Straight line means type advantage / effective against / strong against.\r\n- Dotted line means type disadvantage / not effective against / weak against.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- PSY valks deal more damage against MECH enemies, but deal less damage against BIO enemies.\r\n- IMG valks deal more damage against IMG enemies, but deal less damage against QUA enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Type Counter Bonus\r\nWhen a valk attacks an enemy with type advantage, the valk deals <span class=\"text-amber-300 \">30%</span> more damage.\r\n\r\nIn Abyss mode, the bonus damage becomes even stronger in Type Counter weather: Type counter effect is 20% stronger.\r\n\r\n\r\n## BIO, MECH, PSY\r\nBIO, MECH and PSY types are the first types in the game. These characters / enemies do not have any type-exclusive mechanic besides type counter bonus.\r\n\r\n## Quantum\r\n\r\n### QUA Enemies\r\n1. QUA enemies have a QUA shield. When the shield is active, the QUA enemy takes reduced damage and have higher anti-interrupt. \r\n2. A QUA enemy can have multiple stacks of QUA shields.\r\n\r\n### QUA Characters\r\n1. QUA characters have abilities that can immediately remove stack(s) of QUA shield.\r\n2. Sparkle can insta-kill QUA enemies below 10% HP.\r\n\r\n## Imaginary\r\n\r\n### IMG Enemies\r\n1. IMG enemies have two HP bars - shell hp and seed hp. \r\n2. Your attacks will hit shell hp first. When shell hp bar is depleted, the seed will be exposed, and now you can attack the seed.\r\n3. When seed is exposed, the shell will gradually restore HP. If seed HP is full, it will return to normal, and you have to attack the shell again.\r\n\r\n### IMG Characters\r\n1. Some IMG characters have abilities that can transfer a portion dmg dealt from the shell to the seed.\r\n2. Some IMG characters can insta-kill IMG seed once it is below a certain HP treshold.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Stardust\r\n\r\n### SD Enemies\r\n1. SD enemies utilize 'regular HP' bar and 'Max HP' bar. \r\n2. SD enemies have critical points on their HP bar. When the HP bar reaches the critical point:\r\n    - SD remnants will drop. Any valk can collect the SD remnants to deal big damage to the enemy.\r\n    - They will enter Consolidated state. During this state, attacks will deal damage to Max HP bar.\r\n3. After a certain duration, SD enemy will return to its normal state, and your attacks will deal damage to regular HP bar again.\r\n\r\n### SD Characters\r\n1. SD characters have abilities that can instantly gather SD remnants, and the remnant dmg is stronger.\r\n2. Jovial Deception can instantly trigger critical point.\r\n3. Ba-dum! can reduce 8% of Max HP bar.\r\n"

All valkyries have one element, which can be seen in valkyrie menu. \r\n    - Most modern valkyries only deal damage of their corresponding element.\r\n    - Older valkyries may deal a different damage from their corresponding element.\r\n2. Collectively, Lightning, Ice and Fire DMG are referred to as Elemental DMG. If a buff says it affects Elemental DMG, then it refers to Lightning, Ice and Fire DMG - not Physical DMG.\r\n\r\n3. Unlike Honkai Star Rail and Genshin Impact, in HI3, Elemental DMG cannot crit. Only Physical DMG can crit.\r\n\r\n4. Against enemies with type disadvantage, crit will have white number. You can still crit, it just won't show the yellow number. Why is this a thing? I don't know.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bleed and Ignite DMG\r\nIn 2023, Bleed DMG and Ignite DMG were introduced. These are not new damage elements, rather, they are extra damage elements that exist alongside one of the four main damage elements.\r\nCharacters with Bleed / Ignite DMG benefit from buffs that affect both their primary element and Bleed / Ignite DMG.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yQhz4bO.png\" alt=\"Icon\" class=\"h-[100px] w-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n### Valks with Bleed DMG\r\n- [Peregrine Sword](/valk/ps): Deals Physical DMG, and most of her attacks also count as Bleed DMG.\r\n- [Cosmic Expression](/valk/ce): Deals Physical DMG, and most of her attacks also count as Bleed DMG.\r\n- [Lunar Vow](/valk/lv): Deals Lightning DMG, and most of her attacks also count as Bleed DMG.\r\n- [Valkyrie Quicksand](/valk/vq): Deals Physical DMG, and all of her attacks also count as Bleed DMG.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Valks with Ignite DMG\r\n- [Miracle Magical Girl](/valk/sirin): Deals Fire DMG, and most of her attacks also count as Ignite DMG.\r\n\r\n### Bleed / Ignite DMG vs DoT\r\nAlthough they are not entirely the same, Bleed and Ignite DMG do inherit some properties from Bleed and Ignite status damage-over-time (DoT). For example:\r\n- Bleed DoT <span class=\"text-emerald-400\">does not crit</span>. Valkyrie Quicksand and Cosmic Expression attacks that deal Bleed DMG also cannot crit.\r\n- Bleed / Ignite DoT are <span class=\"text-emerald-400\">not considered as Melee or Ranged DMG</span>. Bleed / Ignite DMG are also not considered as Melee / Ranged DMG.\r\n- If an <span class=\"text-emerald-400\">equipment buffs Bleed / Ignite DMG</span>, it affects both the valk's Bleed / Ignite DoT and Bleed / Ignite DMG.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, valkyries that deal Bleed / Ignite DMG has buffs that are related to the Bleed / Ignite status DoT. For example:\r\n- Miracle Magical Girl's Ultimate count as Ignite DMG, and the damage increases for each Ignite DoT stack that the enemy has.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## HP Loss DMG\r\nHP Loss DMG is a special dmg that only a few valkyries have. It deals a fixed damage and the damage value is equal to a percentage of another damage. Basically like True DMG in Star Rail.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center text-orange-300 \">\r\n  <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XeJEi9t.png\" alt=\"HP Loss DMG\" class=\"h-[300px] w-auto rounded-lg\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nExamples of HP Loss DMG\r\n- Herrscher of Finality: During Stellar Outburst, each Basic ATK deals additional HP Loss DMG, equal to 120% of the Basic ATK's damage.\r\n- Reign Solaris: Against IMG enemies, a portion of damage dealt to IMG shell will be dealt to IMG seed. This damage is HP Loss DMG.\r\n\r\nSome enemies require HP Loss DMG to counter their mechanics. For example, Twin Wardens.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Stardust DMG\r\nThis is a special dmg that can only be done against Stardust (SD) enemies. The more SD remnant stacks you have, the more damage you deal to the enemy's Max HP."

The final damage of HoFi's Ult will be:\r\n\r\n= Base DMG x DMG Multiplier <br/>\r\n= 47,355 x 7.66\r\n  <p class=\"text-lg font-bold text-orange-300\">\r\n    = 362, 739.3 Fire DMG\r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Independent DMG Multipliers\r\n\r\nSome effects provide normal buffs like Total DMG, Physical DMG, etc but during dmg calculation, they **are multiplied** instead of added up with dmg multipliers with the same name. \r\nThese buffs are called **independent damage multipliers.** These are usually very strong dmg buffs since they are multiplicative.\r\n\r\n1. In valkyrie and equipment skill descriptions, if an effect has **(independent)** text, that is an independent dmg multiplier. A valk usually has at least one 'independent' clause in her kit, signature weapon and signature stigma.\r\n\r\n2. Part 2 weapon synergy always have one independent dmg multiplier that affects the team and the valk herself.\r\n\r\n3. Abyss weather effect is an independent dmg multiplier. This is why a lineup that matches / activates the weather effect is better than the ones that don't.\r\n\r\n4. A skill that includes **takes more dmg from the host / wielder** is an independent dmg multiplier.This was tested with Thales M stigma.  It was such a long time ago, I am not sure if this is still true now.\r\n\r\nBut it doesn't really matter. These numbers are just gibberish for most players. Nowadays, every valk has all dmg buffs, but have more restricted activation requirement. And valks just use their signature weapon and stigma, and stigma is farmable now. "

These were very valuable supports for Physical teams.\r\n- Herrscher of Rebirth, Herrscher of Sentience, Celestial Hymn ( DEF -75% )\r\n- Terminal Aide ( DEF -70%, 5 seconds only )\r\n- Divine Prayer ( DEF -80%, random target )\r\n- Weapons: Briareus EX, Twins of Eden ( DEF -65% ) and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Part 2\r\nIn Part 2, so far, all Physical valkyries have their own impair.\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Impair Effect Behavior\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Two impairs do not stack\r\n\r\n**IMPAIRS DO NOT STACK**. The latest impair will override the previous impair. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impair Aura\r\n\r\n<a href='/valk/horb'>Herrscher of Rebirth (HoRB)</a> and <a href='/valk/hos'>Herrscher of Sentience (HoS)</a> impair is like an aura - the impair effect is constantly reapplied every tick on all enemies on the field.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you use Celestial Hymn (CH) impair during HoS impair duration, CH impair will only apply for a split second before HoS impair is reapplied.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What is Physical Breach?\r\nPhysical Breach is basically impair, but **Physical Breach can stack with impair**!\r\n\r\nPhysical Breach was first introduced in version 5.0 for Elysian Realm mode. Since it is a solo mode and most Part 1 Physical DPS cannot apply their own impair, Physical Breach is added as an alternative to impair.\r\n\r\nIn version 7.6, Serapeum AstralOp has Physical Breach for her assist skill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Physical Breach State\r\n\r\nIn version 7.8, Vita [Lone Planetfarer](/valk/lp) is officially the first valkyrie that can provide Physical Breach for other characters. (Physical Breach +37% (S) / 45% (S1)).\r\n\r\nThe Physical Breach is provided through a buff called Physical Breach state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does Physical Breach stack with other Physical Breach\r\n1. Physical Breach stacks with other Physical Breach multiplicatively.\r\n2. Multiple Physical Breach **states** do not stack. You can only have one Physical Breach state. The latest Physical Breach state overrides the previous Physical Breach state. The only exception is with Vita Lone Planetfarer - \r\nVita does not override the previous Physical Breach state, and converts her own Breach state into Physical DMG buff at a certain rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Impair + Phy Breach Calculation\r\nI am not gonna lie, the source for DEF and impair calculation is a very old CN post, and I am not sure if it's still true today. So here is something from a recent post that has a very simple calculation for Impair + Breach\r\n\r\nBasically, Impair stacks with Phy Breach **multiplicatively**.\r\n\r\n- Jovial Deception's impair: DEF -55% => 1-0.55 = 0.45\r\n- Vita's Phy Breach (S-rank): +37% (which is equal to DEF -37%) => 1-0.37 = 0.63\r\n- Impair = 1 - ( 0.45 x 0.63 ) = 0.7165 <br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n  <p class=\"text-lg font-bold text-orange-300\">\r\n    Final Impair = 71.65%\r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n"

But only a few S-rank can give Elemental Breach for other valkyries through a buff called **Elemental Breach state.**\r\n\r\n### Part 1 Valkyries\r\n\r\n1. Azure Empyrea<br/>\r\n  The first valk to provide Elemental Breach state. She's just and fair, she gives Elemental Breach for all valks, no questions asked.\r\n\r\n2. Jade Knight<br/>\r\n  Provides Elemental Breach state only for Ice valkyries.\r\n\r\n3. Herrscher of Truth <br/>\r\n  Provides Elemental Breach state only for Fire and Lightning valkyries.\r\n\r\n4. Lunar Vow <br/>\r\n  Provides Elemental Breach state only for Lightning valkyries.\r\n\r\n### Part 2 Valkyries\r\n\r\n1. Senadina <br/>\r\n  Provides Elemental Breach state for World Star and Wheel of Destiny characters.\r\n\r\n2. Schicksal's Imperative <br/>\r\n  Provides Elemental Breach state only for Theresa characters when AR is not activated.\r\n\r\n3. Vita Lone Planetfarer<br/>\r\n  Provides Elemental Breach state when Astral Ring is activated.\r\n  When WS / WoD / LoA is activated, the Elemental Breach state is only applied for valks with the same AR.\r\n\r\n## Does Elemental Breach stack?\r\n1. Elemental Breach stacks with other Elemental Breach multiplicatively.\r\n2. Multiple Elemental Breach **states** do not stack. You can only have one Elemental Breach state.

That's because **it's missing in english translations**. Hoyoverse is a small indie company, please understand. <br/>\r\n\r\nThe only character that has 'Ele Breach state' properly mentioned in skill description is Vita Lone Planetfarer. \r\nYou can refer to the list above to see which characters give Ele Breach state (generally if the valk gives Breach to other valks, it's Ele Breach state.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in Elysian Realm, Azure Empyrea, Senadina, and Thelema supports all are missing the 'Ele Breach state' clause in their skill description.\r\n"
