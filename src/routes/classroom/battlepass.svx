## Introduction to Battle Pass
HI3 Battle Pass rewards are very different from Honkai Star Rail and Genshin Impact. The biggest differences are:


<div>
<ol>

<li>You get a currency called <span class="text-emerald-300">Crystallum</span> which you can use to buy <b>past gacha equipment</b>.</li>
<li>If you get the paid tier, you can use the Crystallum to get <b>past S-rank character and S-rank ELF </b>.
</li>
<li> Battle Pass  refreshes every patch, but it uses an extra <span class="text-emerald-300">Season</span>  system. Each season lasts for four patches.  More details below.
</li>
</ol>

## BP Tiers
There are three tiers - Vanguard (Free), Knight (Paid), and Paladin (More Expensive).

</div>

Some notable rewards for the paid tier:
- Knight BP gives 9 more Crystallums balls. This tier gives the most balls.
- Knight / Paladin BP unlocks the ability to purchase S-rank character and ELF card / fragments.
- Paladin BP gives 15 more fragments for the featured S-rank, and a lot of Wafer Stabilizer, used to fine-tune your stigma affix stats (this is useful for competitive players).


## BP Season
A BP Season lasts for four patches. (Actual in-game term is BP Theme)

### Crystallum
Crystallum is the currency used to purchase items in BP Works shop. Each season uses a different crystallum.

- The second valk is available for the third and fourth patch.

### Equipment
A new set of equipment is added BP Works shop every patch. The equipment remain in the shop until BP season ends + one more patch.

#### BP Works Vintage
After the BP season ends, **THE EQUIPMENT WILL REMAIN FOR ONE MORE PATCH** in a separate shop called **BP Works Vintage**. This is your last chance to purchase the equipment.
- In Vintage shop, you can convert the new crystallum to the previous crystallum, in case you are short a few crystallum to get an equipment.
- "What? You can use old crystallum to get the new crystallum?!" NO! ðŸ˜  New convert to old! Not old convert to new! ðŸ˜  

Image below shows the vintage shop in v7.8. These are equipment from v7.4-7.7 Battle Pass. When 7.8 ends, the old Crystallum will expire to 15 Torus each.

### BP Arsenal
This shop resets every patch and uses a material called Honor Chips, which also resets every patch (specifically, on Monday of the patch week). Remember to use these before they expire!
