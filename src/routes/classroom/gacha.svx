## Part 2 Supplies
In Part 2, the gacha has been simplified. All Part 2 content are available from these gacha:
- Battlesuit Supply
- Equipment Supply
- AstralOp Supply

Note for characters: Only recent S-rank characters are available from these supplies (at max 7 patches old). Older characters will be available through other means:
- When characters are at least 8 patches old, they will enter a special supply called Ascension Supply (see below).
- They might also be available in Battle Pass and spending event.
- There is still a chance that older characters will rerun in regular supplies, but so far, they don't.

## Pull Valk + Weapon

In Honkai Impact, weapon is very important. Most of the time, signature weapon has a very important utility that completes the valkyrie. There's no good farmable alternative for weapon like in Star Rail or Genshin Impact.

Imagine if Imbibitor Lunae only has maximum 1 Lotus stack by default, and only gets 3 max Lotus stack if he has signature Light Cone.

Well, that's basically what happens to Jovial Deception. She only has 3 meter stack by default, and only gets 6 meter stack with signature weapon.
